The system features:

- A holographic-inspired user interface with sci-fi elements
- RAG-powered question answering using vector search
- Context-aware conversation capability
- Animated interface with bootup sequence
- Interactive panels with detailed information
- Real-time AI chat functionality

## Architecture

JARVIS employs a clean, separated architecture:

1. **Frontend Layer**: React application with TypeScript
   - UI Components
   - Animation logic
   - API service interfaces

2. **API Layer**: FastAPI backend
   - REST endpoints
   - Request validation
   - Response formatting

3. **LLM Processing Layer**:
   - Query processing
   - Context retrieval
   - Response generation

4. **Vector Storage Layer**:
   - Document storage
   - Embedding calculation
   - Similarity search

5. **Document Processing Layer**:
   - PDF parsing
   - Text chunking
   - Metadata extraction

## Frontend Components

The frontend is structured around reusable components:

### JarvisUI (Main Component)

The core UI component that orchestrates the entire interface experience, including:

- Bootup sequence animation
- Welcome message and personalization
- Holographic panels with information
- Chat interface

### Key UI Features

1. **Bootup Sequence**: Simulates system initialization with progress bars and tech-themed messages

2. **Information Panels**: Interactive panels for:
   - Profile
   - Education
   - Recommendations
   - Career
   - Projects
   - Skills

3. **JARVIS Chat Interface**:
   - Two-column layout with suggested questions
   - Real-time chat with the AI
   - Visual indicators for "thinking" state
   - Animated audio visualization

4. **Animations**:
   - Motion effects for all interactive elements
   - Particle background for depth
   - Scan lines for sci-fi aesthetic
   - Pulse effects for key interactive elements

## Backend Services

The backend is organized into several specialized services:

### API Service (`api.py`)

- Handles HTTP requests and responses
- Implements CORS for cross-origin requests
- Provides endpoints for document upload and queries
- Manages error handling and response formatting

### LLM Manager (`llm.py`)

- Integrates with OpenAI API
- Manages conversation context
- Formats prompts with retrieved information
- Handles fallback strategies when RAG fails

### Vector Store Manager (`vector_store.py`)

- Interfaces with Pinecone vector database
- Manages document embeddings
- Performs similarity search for RAG
- Handles index creation and maintenance

### Document Processor (`document_processor.py`)

- Parses PDF documents
- Chunks text for effective embedding
- Extracts metadata for better retrieval
- Preprocesses text for optimal embedding

## RAG Implementation

The Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) system works as follows:

1. **Document Ingestion**:
   - PDF documents containing information about Timal's background are uploaded
   - Documents are parsed and split into semantic chunks
   - Each chunk is embedded using the OpenAI embeddings model
   - Embeddings are stored in Pinecone vector database

2. **Query Processing**:
   - User query is received through the frontend
   - Query is embedded using the same embedding model
   - Vector similarity search finds relevant chunks
   - Retrieved chunks form the context for the LLM

3. **Response Generation**:
   - System prompt defines JARVIS personality and scope
   - Retrieved context is added to the prompt
   - Conversation history is included for continuity
   - OpenAI generates a contextually relevant response
   - Sources are tracked for citation

4. **Fallback Mechanism**:
   - If RAG retrieval fails, falls back to base LLM
   - Error handling preserves user experience
   - Backend logs capture issues for debugging

## API Endpoints

### Frontend API Service

The frontend communicates with the backend through a dedicated service:

```typescript
// Key API functions
queryJarvis(query: string, conversationHistory: Array<{role: string, content: string}>)
uploadDocument(file: File)
checkApiStatus()
clearVectorStore()
```

### Backend Endpoints

1. **GET /** - Health check endpoint
   - Returns API status

2. **POST /upload** - Document upload
   - Accepts PDF files
   - Returns document processing results

3. **POST /query** - RAG query endpoint
   - Accepts user query and conversation history
   - Returns AI response with source citations

4. **POST /clear** - Admin endpoint
   - Clears the vector database
   - For development use only
